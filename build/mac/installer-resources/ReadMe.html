<p>Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and performance management.</p>

<p>The PCP open source release provides a unifying abstraction for all of
the interesting performance data in a system, and allows client
applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of that data
using a single API.</p>

<p>A client-server architecture allows multiple clients to monitor the
same host, and a single client to monitor multiple hosts (e.g. in a
Beowulf cluster).  This enables centralized monitoring of distributed
processing.</p>

<p>Integrated archive logging and replay so a client application can use
the same API to process real-time data from a host or historical data
from an archive.</p>

<p>The framework supports APIs and configuration file formats that enable
the scope of performance monitoring to be extended at all levels.<p>

<p>The open source release of PCP provides a subset of the features of
SGI's Performance Co-Pilot products for IRIX (see
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/software/co-pilot/">http://www.sgi.com/software/co-pilot/</a>).</p>

<p>The architecture and services of the base PCP infrastructure are
especially attractive for those tackling the harder system-level
performance problems.  For example this may involve a transient
performance degradation, or some complex interaction between resource
demands on a single system, or those seeking centralized monitoring of
distributed processing (e.g. in a cluster or webserver farm
environment), or management of performance on large systems with lots
of moving parts.</p>

<p>The open source release of PCP includes all of the PCP libraries,
infrastructure and daemons, along with a Darwin agent that exports a
broad range of performance data from 7.4.x (Mac OSX 10.4.x).
This includes coverage of activity in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CPU 
    <li>disk 
    <li>memory 
    <li>swapping 
    <li>network 
    <li>NFS 
    <li>RPC 
    <li>filesystems 
    <li>all the per-process statistics 
</ul>
<p>Other agents export performance data from: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Web server activity logs 
    <li>arbitrary application-level tracing (via a PCP trace library) 
    <li>Cisco routers 
    <li>sendmail 
    <li>the mail queue 
    <li>the PCP infrastructure itself 
</ul>
