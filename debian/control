Description: System level performance monitoring and performance management
 Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to
 support system-level performance monitoring and performance
 management.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
