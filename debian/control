Description: System level performance monitoring and performance management
 Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to
 support system-level performance monitoring and performance
 management.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.

Package: libpcp3-dev

Depends: libc6-dev | libc-dev, libpcp3
Architecture: any
Description: Performance Co-Pilot library and headers
 libpcp-dev contains the base Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) library and
 header files needed to develop both collector and monitor programs
 which make use of PCP services.

Package: libpcp3
Depends: cpp
Section: libs

Architecture: any
Description: Performance Co-Pilot Domain Agent library and headers
 libpcppmda-dev contains the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) library and
 header files needed to develop Performance Metric Domain Agents
 (PMDAs).  A PMDA exports performance data for one specific domain,
 for example the operating system kernel, Cisco routers, a database,
 an application, etc.
