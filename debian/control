Description: System level performance monitoring and performance management
 Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services to
 support system-level performance monitoring and performance
 management.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.

Description: Performance Co-Pilot Domain Agent Perl module
 The PCP::PMDA Perl module contains the language bindings for
 building Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs) using Perl.
 Each PMDA exports performance data for one specific domain, for
 example the operating system kernel, Cisco routers, a database,
 an application, etc.

Package: libpcp-logsummary-perl
Section: perl
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: pcp
Description: Performance Co-Pilot historical log summary module
 The PCP::LogSummary module provides a Perl module for using the
 statistical summary data produced by the Performance Co-Pilot
 pmlogsummary utility.  This utility produces various averages,
 minima, maxima, and other calculations based on the performance
 data stored in a PCP archive.  The Perl interface is ideal for
 exporting this data into third-party tools (e.g. spreadsheets).
