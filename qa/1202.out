=== Setting up QA fakeroot testing data ===


=== Installing Device Mapper PMDA ===
You will need to choose an appropriate configuration for installation of
the "dm" Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).

  collector	collect performance statistics on this system
  monitor	allow this system to monitor local and/or remote systems
  both		collector and monitor configuration for this system

Please enter c(ollector) or m(onitor) or b(oth) [b] Updating the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) ...

=== Preparing for Test Device Mapper Device
creating pseudo device
creating loop device /dev/loop0
creating device mapper device stastics looptest0
looptest0: Created new region with 1 area(s) as region ID 0

Help:
This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O merge,
or read of these stats by the number of I/Os in progress multiplied by
the number of nanoseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of
this field. This can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time
and the backlog that may be accumulating.
