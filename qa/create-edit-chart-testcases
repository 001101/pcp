BUGS/TODO
- Double click on compressed Available Metric tree name not expanding
  (but works fine for Chart Plots tree).
- Verify metric plots are valid: at all (strings, aggregates), and
  together (compatible units, etc).
- Maximum Y-Axis setting not enforced (still auto-scales if limit is
  reached)?
- Adding multiple metrics *instances* to a new chart, only one ends
  up being added.  Multiple (null-indom) metrics works fine though.

Creating and Editing Charts
===========================

Live Create

[ ] Start kmchart, click on New Chart in the File Menu Item or Toolbar.
    Verify that the New Chart dialog is displayed with no entries in
    the Chart Plots list, one host in the Available Metrics list, and
    one level of the local hosts metric namespace expanded.
[ ] Resize the window, down to its minimum size and up to a larger size
    than the initial window.  Verify the child widget layout remains as
    sensible as possible for the window size.
[ ] Before selecting anything click on the OK push button, and verify
    that a warning dialog is displayed (No metrics selected), that
    the New Chart dialog remains on screen and no chart is created in
    the main kmchart window.

[ ] Verify the metic namespace traversal and selection functionality:
    - Double click on the hostname, verify the metric list collapses.
    - Double click on the hostname, verify the list reappears.
    - Select "sample", then "seconds".  Verify the full metric path has
      appeared in the text box below the list.
    - Click the blue Metric Info button and in the Info dialog verify
      that the Info tab displays the metric name, short help text,
      descriptor (type, indom, semantics, units), long help, and the
      current value.  Then click on the Value tab, which should cause
      the kmtime live window to be displayed and the current values
      for sample.seconds should be reported at the current interval.
    - Click the red Delete button.  It should be disabled, so nothing
      should happen here at this stage.
    - Click the left-arrow button and verify the metric appears in the
      Chart Plots list, fully expanded, and with the default colour.
    - Now click the big red Smite button again, and verify the metric
      is removed from the Chart Plots list.
    - Select samples.seconds again from the Available Metrics list, and
      press OK.  Verify that a line plot chart is created which starts
      plotting this metric (its value should constantly hover very close
      to the sample interval).

[ ] Verify default metric colors
    - Open the Settings dialog and select the Colors tab.
    - Open the New Chart dialog, navigate to sample.hordes in the
      Available Metrics list, and (multi-) select the first 50 instances.
    - Click OK and verify from the legend that the colours selected match
      the default plot colour rotation.
    - Select Delete Chart from the Edit menu.

[ ] Verify chart metadata
    - Open the New Chart dialog, navigate to sample.load and click
      on the left-arrow button to add it to the Chart Plots list.
    - Click on the Chart tab, and modify the following attributes:
      Title: NewChartQA
      Style: Area Plot
      Legend: Off
      Y-Axis	Auto-Scale: Off
		Min: 40
		Max: 45
    - Click OK, and verify that the chart is created with all of these
      parameters in effect.
    - Close the Chart
    - Open the New Chart dialog, navigate to the sample metrics and
      select both recv_pdu and xmit_pdu, and add them to the Chart Plot
      list simultaneously using the left-arrow button.
    - Click on the Chart tab and set Style: to Stacked Bar.
    - Click OK, and verify that a stacked bar chart is created.
    - Close the Chart

[ ] Add Host
    - Open up the New Chart dialog
    - Push the Add Host button
	- enter no.such.host and verify nothing bad happens
	- enter your valid remote QA host and verify it is added to
	  the Available Metrics list with its top level metric names.
    - Select sample.long.one from the first host, and sample.long.ten
      from the second, and add the two metrics to the Chart Plot list.
    - Click on the Chart dialog, and set the style to Stacked Bar.
    - Click on OK and verify that a bar chart is created with the two
      metrics, one from each host, values one and ten respectively.
    - Close the Chart

[ ] Verify color selection Tab
    - Open up the New Chart dialog
    - Add the sample.drift metric to the Chart Plots and click Colors.
    - Verify that the First colour box (below Revert button) displays
      the current (#-cycle default) colour.
    - Drag the cursor around in the color and darkness selection boxes
      and verify that the colour box above the Apply (left arrow) push
      button changes as you move the cursor.  Verify that the HSV/RGV
      values change as well.
    - Type into each of the HSV/RGB spin boxes - they should not accept
      non-numeric input, modifying a value on one row (HSV or RGB) will
      affect values on the other, and all have a range between 0 - 255,
      except for Hue, which is 0 - 359.
    - Select a colour different to the default plot colour, and press
      the Apply button.  Verify that the colour displayed in the Chart
      Plot list is updated.
    - Press the Revert button, and verify that the colour displayed in
      the Chart Plot list is reverted to its previous value.
    - Press OK.


Live Edit

[ ] Click on Edit Chart from the Edit menu.  Verify that the metric
    from the previous exercise (sample.drift) is the only one displayed
    in the Chart Plots list, and its colour matches the previous colour.
[ ] Select sample.drift in the Chart Plots list.

[ ] Verify the color selection Tab
    - Select a new (different) colour and press the left-arrow button to
      Apply the change.
    - Enter a plot label of "Drifter".
    - Press OK, and verify that the chart changes to using the new colour
      and new legend label for its sample.drift plot.

[ ] Verify changing each piece of chart metadata
    - Click on the Edit Chart action, and modify the following attributes:
      Title: EditChartQA
      Style: Utilization
      Legend: Off
      Y-Axis	Auto-Scale: Off
		Min: 1
		Max: 1
    - Click OK, and verify that a window is displayed preventing min/max
      from being the same.
    - Change Y-Axis Max: to 1.
    - Click OK, and verify that the chart is created with all of these
      parameters in effect.
    - Click on the Edit Chart action, and modify the following attributes:
      Title: EditChartQA2
      Style: Line Plot
      Legend: On
      Y-Axis Auto-Scale: On
    - Click OK, and verify that the chart is created with all of these
      parameters in effect.

[ ] Verify adding and removing metrics
    - Bring up the Edit Chart dialog.  Select the sample.drift metric from
      Chart Plots and press the red Delete button.  Now press OK, and make
      sure that a dialog is displayed preventing the creation of a chart
      with no metrics.
    - Press Cancel.
    - Bring up the Edit Chart dialog.  Select the sample.drift metric from
      Chart Plots and press the red Delete button.  Select sample.load in
      the Available Metrics list, add it to the Chart Plots list, and then
      press OK.  Verify that the chart is now displaying only sample.load.
       

Archive Create

[ ] Click on the Archive Tab.  Click on the New Chart toolbutton.  Click
    on the Archive push button, and open up kmchart/qa/archives/viewqa1,
    kmchart/qa/archives/viewqa2 and kmchart/qa/archives/viewqa3.
[ ] Verify that the hosts "edge" and "leaf" are displayed along with the
    top level of their respective metric namespaces.
    Verify also that the Time Axis in the main window has been updated
    to display a timeframe in September 2007, EST.
[ ] Create a CPU view from the archive
    - Select all of the kernel.all.cpu metrics from the Available Metrics
      list and add them to the Chart Plots list.
    - Modify each of the colours - dark blue for "user", red for "sys",
      "green" for idle, cyan for "wait.total" and light yellow for "intr".
    - Change the chart properties:
      Title: CPU Utilisation QA
      Style: utilisation
    - Press OK and inspect your handiwork.
[ ] Close the Archive Tab.


Error handling

[ ] Go through all the "problematic" sample PMDA metrics and verify:
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.darkness.
	(should not be possible - instance domain but no values)
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.noinst.
	(should not be possible - no instance domain)
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.needprofile.
	(should not be possible - no profile set)
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.string.null
	(should not be possible - string value)
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.aggregate.null
	(should not be possible - aggregate value)
    - Attempt to create a chart with sample.bad.unknown
	(should not be possible - unknown PMID)
