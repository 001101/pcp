# PCP QA Test No. 655
# checks extended pmdagfs2 functionality (gfs2_tracepoints)
# Requires GFS2 support in the kernel, so may need a "modprobe gfs2" 
# depending on how you like to roll your kernels.
#
# The gfs2_glock_lock_time tracepoint metrics require debugfs mounted, 
# tracing enabled and also the gfs2_glock_lock_time tracepoint enabled.
# The enabling of this tracepoint is attempted in the setup phase of the
# test.
