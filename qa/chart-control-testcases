BUGS/TODO
=========

- Alignment of charts vertically
- Disabling chart auto-scale and setting limit only updates on next
  chart update (so, if Stopped, doesn't take effect until Playing).
  Need a replot?
- Moving backward at high speed (400?) caused (looke like) a step/
  VCR event to be missed, and kmchart got state display out of sync
  with kmtime and then no further time control possible (kmtime was
  probably awaiting an ACK that didn't arrive).
- kmchart time control icon is not updated to reflect Stopped state
  when we move fastfwd to end of archive, or fastback to the start.
  In fact, it doesn't get updated in normal or step mode either.
- kmtime layout mucked up on MacOSX - in archive mode, big gap below
  the position slider; in live mode, position line edit is stretched
  vertically.
- kmtime needs a Toolbar (mainly for MacOSX).  May fix above issue.
- kmchart -a no.such.file gives a QT list assert failure.
- kmtime Hide icon is wrong when in Live mode on MacOSX.
- kmchart time axis not updating with timezone change.
- When started in archive mode, why doesn't the Live tab time axis
  update at all?  Seems like it should.
- Vice-versa, need to find a way to make the archive time axis look
  decent when starting in Live mode too


Chart Correctness and Control
=============================

Live mode

[ ] Run: kmchart -c views/ScaleManual -t 1
    This should display two charts - the top one with instantaneous
    sample metrics (sample.double.one and sample.double.ten), lower
    chart with one counter metric (sample.byte_ctr).
[ ] Select the top chart, open the Edit Chart dialog, disable Auto-
    Scaling on the Y-Axis.  Set Minimum to zero, Maximum to 11,
    and press OK.  Verify that the Y-Axis increases to this range.

[ ] Repeat the above, except now set the Maximum to 5.  Verify that
    the Y-Axis updates to show the new maximum and that only the
    yellow chart (sample.double.one) remains visible.
[ ] Repeat once more, now setting Minimum to 5 and Maximum to 11.
    Verify the Y-Axis scale change and that only the blue plot
    (sample.double.ten) is now visible.

[ ] Click the Live button to expose the Time Controls.  Press the
    Stop button.  Wait 5 seconds, then press Play.
[ ] Verify that there is a "gap" in all chart data (not zero) for
    the time stopped, then it should continue to plot as before.

[ ] Change the Interval to 0 seconds, and then press Play.
    Verify that the Interval returns back to its previous valid
    state and the charts are updated as before.
[ ] Change the Interval to 1.5 seconds, and then press Play.
    Verify that the time pulse is emitted now every two seconds
    and that the display is updated at that frequency now.

[ ] Change the Timezone to UTC in the Time Control dialog.
    Verify that the position text is updated with the new time,
    and that the kmchart time axis is updated also.
[ ] Change back to localtime, verify position and time axis again.


Archive mode

[ ] Run: kmchart -c views/ManualScaleQA -t 1 -a archives/chartqa1
    This should display two charts - the top one with instantaneous
    sample metrics (sample.double.one and sample.double.ten), lower
    chart with one counter metric (sample.byte_ctr).  The initial
    display should show a series of values for Thurs, Oct 11 2007,
    with one visible "gap" in the series (both charts, same time).

[ ] Click the Archive button to expose the Time Controls.
[ ] Press Play, and let it run through to the end of the archive
    (its not very long).  There should be two time periods where
    no values are displayed (note: plotting should stop completely
    in these sections - broken lines, the plot values should *not*
    dip to zero).
[ ] Verify that when the end of the archive is reached, the time
    controls are updated to Stop state, in both the Time Control
    window and kmchart.
[ ] Press Back, and let it run back to the start of the archive.
    Verify that when the start of the archive is reached, time
    controls are updated to Stop state in both the Time Control
    window and kmchart.
[ ] Change the Archive Control mode to Step, then take three steps
    forward, and four steps back.  Verify that the time controls
    are update to Stop state in both the Time Control window and
    kmchart.
[ ] Change the Archive Control mode to Fast.  Fast forward to the
    end of the archive, verify it stops at the end, then fast back
    to the start.  Again verify that it stops, and the interface
    state (icons) in both windows is updated to indicate this.
[ ] Change back to Normal Archive Control mode.  Press Play.  Now
    increase and decrease the playback Speed while kmchart is
    displaying the data from the archive.  Use both the direct
    text input mechanism, and the wheel.  You can use the little
    button next to the wheel to reset Speed to its original value.
[ ] Play space invaders!  Randomly change mode, direction, speed,
    etc. and verify that the interface doesn't get into a hung or
    unexpected state.

[ ] Change the Interval to 0 seconds, and then press Play.
    Verify that the Interval returns back to its previous valid
    state and the charts are updated as before.
[ ] Change the Interval to 1.5 seconds, and then press Play.
    Verify that the time pulse is emitted now every two seconds
    and that the display is updated at that frequency now.

[ ] Change the Timezone to UTC in the Time Control dialog.
    Verify that the position text is updated with the new time,
    and that the kmchart time axis is updated also.  Also verify
    that the Archive Bounds dialog displays an updated timeframe.
[ ] Change back to localtime from the archive; verify position,
    time axis and Archive Bounds again.
