kmchart is designed to produce stripcharts from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics fetched from live sources (one or more pmcd hosts) and
also historical sources (one or more PCP archives).

kmtime is a graphical time controller utility that coordinates time updates
and VCR-like playback for other utilities like kmchart and pmval.

Instructions on building these tools can be found in doc/INSTALL.  Consult
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp/ for additional details about these tools.


=== Planned for 2.0 ===

    - Dock Layout
	- Make a QTabBar the QMainWindow "central" widget
	- Replace use of QSplitter with QMainWindow QDockWidgets,
	  and cunning use of save/restore with Tab switches
	- Allow saving Tab layouts in views (maybe, see below)
	- Placement user interaction (menu over charts), allow
	  arbitrary chart (gadget) movement, including between
	  (like) Tabs.
	- Placement functionality - strip charts vs gadgets -
	  if any gadgets places side-by-side, strip charts need
	  to switch to local time axis and hide unified axis.
	- Allow hiding of status bar, which also means switching
	  to non-unified time axis mode.
	- New Toolbar items (new toolbar &| Preferences update).
    - Chart gadget (with Y-axis)
    - Bar2d gadget (horizonal/vertical - gmemusage/grosview-like)
    - Bar3d gadget (pmview-like)
    - LED gadget (pmgadgets-like)
    - Label gadget (pmgadgets-like)
    - Value gadget (new - optionally use QLCDNumber)

    - Consider: extended kmchart view format (interim) or switch
      to using script-based views in this release?  Probably too
      much to take on for one release (not clear on the language
      choice yet either - Perl or QtScript?).  Maybe release 2.0
      without view format extension (i.e. no gadget support, and
      no individual chart geometry support).  Then implement API
      and script-language-view support in 3.0?

    - Need to regenerate many screenshots (Tutorial/Manual) with
      whatever the final windows look like.


=== Wishlist TODO items ===

    - Merge Qwt 5.1 sources.
    - The Qt-based metrics class needs:
      o A hash for metric instance values instead of an array
	(to support delete, and better support of dynamic indoms)
    - kmtime should send a message to all clients on show/hide (except
      for the client that explicitly requested the show/hide, if there
      was one) - this would let the clients correctly track whether it
      is visible/not (kmchart displays this state in the Options menu,
      and uses that state to decide whether a hide/show is needed).
    - Extend kmdumptext to use an abstracted kmtime class for kmtime
      VCR control.
    - Extend kmdumptext to allow input to drive kmtime remotely (will
      need to allow SET message from clients at any time, not just on
      initial exchange) and use this to automate QA of kmtime.
    - Write automated QA for Save View (need a new command line option),
      then with -C and -c, open (multiple) views, save, then verify.
    - kmquery window initial sizing and resizing could use improvement.
