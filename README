kmtools Source Guide and TODO List

kmchart and kmtime are replacements for SGI's pmchart and pmtime.
kmchart is designed to produce stripcharts from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics fetched from either a live source (one or more hosts)
or from one or more PCP archives.  kmtime is a graphical time controller
utility that coordinates time updates and VCR-like playback for other
utilities, such as kmchart and pmval.

The SGI documentation for PCP tools in general is here
http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/browse.cgi?\
    coll=0650&db=bks&cmd=toc&pth=/SGI_Admin/PCP_UAG
and, in particular, pmchart is documented in Chapter 4.
Further information can be gleaned from the pmchart man page at
http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?\
    coll=linux&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/man1/pmchart.1.html

Building kmchart

    Refer to ./INSTALL

Running kmchart

    At this stage, kmchart is only being made available as source
    code, so you'll need to build it from source first.

TODO

    Refer to the TODO comments in the source code, else run
    tools/what-todo for the full chapter and verse details.

    kmchart TODO list:
    - Try building and running with QT4 (currently only QT3 tried)
    - Try building and running with QWT5 library/headers.
    - Visible/sample History config changes
    - Dumps core on changing Visible Plots - undiagnosed
    - Ability to move charts up/down vertically within a Tab
	(use up/down arrow keys? - ideal cos thats just one change
	 at a time then - nice&easy code & dwiinterface wise).
	QVBoxLayout::remove and QVBoxLayout::insertWidget look like
	the Qt mechanism for implementing this.
    - Unified time axis, still to do:
	o Scaling of the tick marks on the Y-axis is far from correct,
	  and causes mis-alignment on the unified X-axis.  The disk
	  thoughput (bytes) show this up clearly, for example.
	o Respond to changes in the sampling interval from kmtime.
    - Resolve what to do about plot legends (try out Qwt5+ first..)
	o Better to have them at the top of the chart below title?
	o Would be good to get rid of the pushbutton shading around
	  each, and instead rely solely on the Box<->Line transition
	  to show state (i.e. plot displayed or not).
	o Probably need to take QwtLegend and modify it alot, I
	  doubt whether ideal behaviour can be achieved by workaround
	  or subclassing.
	o Plot labels (displayed in legend, supported in the kmchart
	  View file format) need to be supported in the New/Edit
	  Chart dialog - need to preserve existing ones, and need to
	  be able to create/modify existing labels.
    - Rethink searching in New/Edit Chart dialogs - could be done by
	making the (gray background) text box double as a search text
	entry point.  Something like vi's /<pattern> key sequence to
	initiate new/next searches, with wrap-around to the top.
	The Firefox mechanism is kinda similar - take another look at
	that and see if anything can be learned from that.
    - Destructors and memory leak plugging
    - Online Help support
    - Incorporate a Tutorial into Help too, useful for talks
    - Tooltips need to be added across the board.
    - Timezone support not completely working
    - All the usual PCP tool options need to be introduced, such
      as -S, -O, -T, etc.
    - Auto-update the version string in the About dialog.
    - The System/User buttons on the Open View dialog are smaller
      than the other toolbox buttons alongside them.
    - File->Record support - mostly working, needs lots more testing and
      better error handling.  Should also try find more unique filenames
      for each successive run, even just a simple in-memory counter would
      be a big help (then append this to the default record file names).
    - In Record mode we currently implement the old pmchart behaviour,
      which is to display a message about using pmafm when recording is
      stopped.  We could do much better by opening a new Tab (maybe have
      an option as to which path is taken), such that the replay is all
      ready to go immediately, "in-line" in the current kmchart.  A third
      option would be to start a new kmchart instance (can be attached to
      the current kmtime already, as both live and archive mode supported
      together now) with the archive+view ready to go.
    - Also wrt record mode configuration, we may want a QSession setting
      to allow a different default record interval, so that theres no need
      to set it to something else on each record invocation.
    - D'oh - when implementing record mode, I forgot about the code inside
      pmlogger to support "detach" functionality (pmlogger.c -x option);
      should go back and make use of those control-fd functions.
    - Fix up build to generate the pixmaps (PNG) from the SVG files,
      as is done in the Tango-Desktop-Icons package builds (ImageMagick).
      This should fix up the ordinary look to some of the current icons.
    - pmproxy support is far from complete:
      o Need to spilt host selection combobox and dialog into separate
	host/proxy widgets
      o Need a LineEdit for port numbers (list of) too on each dialog
      o Need libpcp changes (new interfaces) to abstract out the code
        which has a one-trip guard on testing/setting PMPROXY_HOST env
	variable during connect (so multiple contexts can have different
	proxies).

    kmtime TODO list:
    - Finished, perfect, no bugs exist.  (yeah, right)
    - Needs online help ala kmchart
    - See "make fix" in Makefile - needs a QtDesigner fix?
      (may be able to workaround by not dynamically adding the UTC
	entry in the Timezone dropdown menu?)

    PCP extensions
    - The pmSetMode(3) API needs a replacement that takes a timeval
      structure for a delta, instead of an integer.  The extended
      time base code should be factored out (into the old, backward
      compatible pmSetMode) and deprecated - used in pmval(1) atm.
    - This timeval delta change needs to be pushed all the way down
      into the PCP context structure, which fortunately isn't exposed
      outside of impl.h (AFAICT) - this would be an issue if it was,
      as the size of that structure will change due to relacing the
      current integer delta with a timeval.
    - Not much uses the integer delta however, its mainly interp.c in
      libpcp that uses it.  Note: libpcp_pmc also has an API that's
      affected here - PMC_Group::setArchiveMode
