kmchart is designed to produce stripcharts from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics fetched from live sources (one or more pmcd hosts) and
also historical sources (one or more PCP archives).

kmtime is a graphical time controller utility that coordinates time updates
and VCR-like playback for other utilities like kmchart and pmval.

Instructions on building these tools can be found in doc/INSTALL.  Consult
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp/ for additional details about these tools.


=== Wishlist TODO items ===

    - MacOSX packaging needs work:
      o Install it as a "real" Application, not a regular Unix tool.
      o MacOSX icon artwork needs further touch-ups to look good;
      o Refer to "Setting the Application Icon" page in QtAssistant.
    - The Qt-based metrics class needs:
      o A hash for metric instance values instead of an array
	(to support delete, and better support of dynamic indoms)
    - kmtime should send a message to all clients on show/hide (except
      for the client that explicitly requested the show/hide, if there
      was one) - this would let the clients correctly track whether it
      is visible/not (kmchart displays this state in the Options menu,
      and uses that state to decide whether a hide/show is needed).
    - QwtLegend use needs a complete revamp - see all the hacks in the
      kmchart code related to fixLegendPen().  Print/Export do not do
      anything useful with the legend at the moment, which is a shame.
    - Extend kmdumptext to use an abstracted kmtime class for kmtime
      VCR control.
    - Extend kmdumptext to allow input to drive kmtime remotely (will
      need to allow SET message from clients at any time, not just on
      initial exchange) and use this to automate QA of kmtime.
    - Write automated QA for Save View (need a new command line option),
      then with -C and -c, open (multiple) views, save, then verify.
    - kmquery window initial sizing and resizing could use improvement.
