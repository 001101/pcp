kmchart is designed to produce stripcharts from Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics fetched from live sources (one or more pmcd hosts) and
also historical sources (one or more PCP archives).

kmtime is a graphical time controller utility that coordinates time updates
and VCR-like playback for other utilities like kmchart and pmval.

Refer to doc/INSTALL for instructions on building these tools.


=== 1.0 TODO list ===

    - Write interactive QA testcases as each area is checked:
	[x] qa/record-testcases
	[x] qa/search-testcases
	[x] qa/settings-testcases
	[x] qa/view-create-save-testcases

	[x] qa/export-print-testcases
	[ ] qa/query-testcases
    - Write automated QA for Save View (need a new command line option),
      then with -C and -c, open (multiple) views, save, then verify.

    - Tab issues
       o On initially creating a live tab, the time axis is very confused (it
	 looks like its trying to display way too many points?).  This clears
	 itself up after a few kmtime steps though.
	 Values in CPU/Disk views opened on a new Live Tab do not match those
	 from an initial Tab.
       o Stopping recording causes time axis on the current Live Tab to go
	 haywire (changing Tabs then changing back clears it though).
       o After recording, view y-axes are not correct (views not created to
	 match originals correctly?).
       o After recording, kmtime refuses to show itself, time axis is all
	 wierd (lots of timestamps one-on-top-of-the-other).
       o New Tab after recording needs to have total/visible samples set to
	 match the original tab.  
       o Tab label of a recording Tab should be "Record" not the start time,
	 that takes too much space and is hard-to-read.

    - Online Help needs more content
    - Tutorial is not quite complete
    - WhatsThis markers need to be added across the board.

    - Destructors and memory leak plugging.
    - Code audit for TODOs; either fix, exception or add to wishlist.
    - QA test audit for TODOs; either fix, exception or add to wishlist.

  kmquery

    - Argument -button is not working correctly anymore (Qt4)
    - Window initial sizing and resizing still needs work.


=== Wishlist TODO items ===

    - The Qt-based metrics class needs:
      o A hash for metric instance values instead of an array
	(to support delete, and better support of dynamic indoms)
      o Per-context support for pmproxy
    - pmproxy support is far from complete:
      . Need libpcp changes (new interfaces) to abstract out the code
	which has a one-trip guard on testing/setting PMPROXY_HOST env
	variable during connect (so multiple contexts can have different
	proxies).
      . Need Qmc support for these interfaces instead of existing code.
      . Need to audit kmchart, see all PMPROXY TODOs in the code.
    - Desktop integration details - basics are done, but:
      o Gnome/KDE icon files need to be installed correctly;
      o MacOSX icon artwork needs further touch-ups to look good;
      o Refer to "Setting the Application Icon" page in QtAssistant.
      o Entry should be created in the Application menu/list/folder.
      o kmchart should be started (with -c) when a View is clicked.
	Might be enough (or best we can do) to just document how this
	is achieved for each supported platform.
    - kmtime should send a message to all clients on show/hide (except
      for the client that explicitly requested the show/hide, if there
      was one) - this would let the clients correctly track whether it
      is visible/not (kmchart displays this state in the Options menu,
      and uses that state to decide whether a hide/show is needed).
    - QwtLegend use needs a complete revamp - see all the hacks in the
      kmchart code related to fixLegendPen().  Print/Export do not do
      anything useful with the legend at the moment, which is a shame.


=== PCP extensions ===

    - Some pmproxy changes are required in libpcp (see wishlist above)
      which will also require some new PMAPI interfaces.  The reason
      for these changes is to separate out the current behaviour that
      allows only one PMPROXY_HOST setting to be used for the life of
      a PCP client program, and instead allow the user to choose (and
      choose differently for differnt hosts), the pmproxy host that's
      associated with any pmcd host.
    - The pmSetMode(3) API needs a replacement that takes a timeval
      structure for a delta, instead of an integer.  The extended
      time base code should be factored out (into the old, backward
      compatible pmSetMode) and deprecated - used in pmval(1) atm.
    - This timeval delta change needs to be pushed all the way down
      into the PCP context structure, which fortunately isn't exposed
      outside of impl.h (AFAICT) - this would be an issue if it was,
      as the size of that structure will change due to relacing the
      current integer delta with a timeval.
    - Not much uses the integer delta however, its mainly interp.c in
      libpcp that uses it.  Note: libpcp_pmc also has an API that's
      affected here - PMC_Group::setArchiveMode
