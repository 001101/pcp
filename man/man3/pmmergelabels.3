.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmMergeLabels
takes multiple (\c
.IR nsets )
performance metric label
.I sets
and merges them into a single result
.I buffer
of
.I length
bytes.
Both the input
.I sets
and the result
.I buffer
are
.IR name : value
pairs in the "JSONB" format described on
.BR pmGetLabels (1).
.PP
The format of the
.I pmLabelSet
data structure is described in detail in
.BR pmGetLabels (3).
.PP
Although names may repeat across the provided label
.IR sets ,
duplicate names are not allowed in the final
.IR buffer .
Any label names occuring in more than one of the input label
.I sets
are reduced to one using the rules described in the "PRECEDENCE"
section of
.BR pmGetLabels .
The position of each element in the
.I sets
array is significant in terms of the precedence rules \- earlier
positions are taken to be of lower precedence to later positions.
.PP
Values must be primitive JSON entities (e.g. numbers, strings),
one-dimensional arrays or maps (i.e. simple associative arrays).
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On success, both
.B pmMergeLabels
and
.B pmMergeLabelSets
returns the number of bytes written into the supplied
.IR buffer .
.PP
Failure to parse the input strings, failure to allocate memory, or any
internal inconsistencies found will result in a negative return code.
