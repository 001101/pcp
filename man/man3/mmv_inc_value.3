.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f3mmv_inc_value\f1 provides a convenient way of updating a value 
returned by the \f3mmv_lookup_value_desc\f1.
\f2addr\f1 is the address returned from \f3mmv_stats_init\f1().
.P
The value of the \f2inc\f1 is internally cast to match the type of
the metric and then added to the previous value of the metric.
