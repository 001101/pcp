.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CW
.ie t \f(CW\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
For the instance domain
.IR indom ,
in the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context,
locate the instance with the internal instance identifier given
by 
.IR inst ,
and return the full external instance identification via
.IR name .
.PP
The value for the instance domain
.I indom
is typically extracted from a
.CW pmDesc
structure, following a call to
.BR pmLookupDesc (3)
for a particular performance metric.
.PP
The space for the value of
.I name
will have been allocated in
.B pmNameInDom
with
.BR malloc (3C),
and it is the responsibility of the caller to
.BR free (3C)
the space when it is no longer required.
.PP
.B pmNameInDom
returns zero on success.
.PP
\f3pmRequestInDomName\fP and \f3pmReceiveInDomName\fP are used by
applications which must communicate with the PMCD asynchornously.
These functions take explicit context handle \f2ctx\fP which must refer
to a host context (i.e. created by passing \f3PM_CONTEXT_HOST\fP to
\f3pmNewContext\fP). \f3pmRequestInDomName\fP sends request to translate
internal instance identifier to external instance name to PMCD and
returns immediately, \f3pmReceiveInDomName\fP reads reply from PMCD
without waiting, it is the responsibility of the application to make
sure the data are ready before calling \f3pmReceiveInDomName\f1.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_INDOM\f1
.I indom
is not a valid instance domain identifier
