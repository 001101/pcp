.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see

.B pmiErrStr
translates error codes returned from the other routines
in the Log Import library into printable error messages.

As a special case, if
.I sts
is -1 then the error code returned from the last routine
called in the LOGIMPORT library for this context will be
used.
.PP
The set of possible error codes and messages is all those defined
by
.BR pmErrStr (3)
and
.BR PCPIntro (3),
plus the additonal ones defined in
.B <pcp/import.h>
with error code names of the form
.BR PMI_ERR_....
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None.
