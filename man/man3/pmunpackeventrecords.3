.SH NAME
\f3pmUnpackEventRecords\f1 \- unpack event records
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"

#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CW
.ie t \f(CW\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Event records are encoded as a packed array of records within a
.I pmResult
using a container metric with a value of type
.BR PM_TYPE_EVENT .
.PP
.B pmUnpackEventRecords
may be used to unpack event records from a metric value
identified by
.IR vsp .
The unpacked records are turned into
.I pmResult
structures, one per event record and one metic per event parameter, and
.I rap
is returned as a pointer to an array (NULL pointer terminated) of
pointers to the
.I pmResult
structures.
.PP
If
.I nmissed
is not NULL, the number of missed event records (if any) is returned
via
.IR nmissed .
.PP
.B pmUnpackEventRecords
returns the number of
.I pmResults
as the return value, which is >= 0 for success.
.PP
.I rset
and the associated
.I pmResult
structures may be freed using the convenience function
.BR pmFreeEventResult (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The following errors are possible:
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_CONV
The values associated with
.I vsp
are not encoded using the format PM_VAL_DPTR or PM_VAL_SPTR.
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_INST
The value associated with
.I vsp
is not singular as expected.
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_TYPE
.I vsp
is not a value of type
.BR PM_TYPE_EVENT .
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_TOOSMALL
The value identifed by
.I vbp
is not legal because the value length is less than the minimum size,
or the number of event records encoded in the (value header)
.I pmEventArray
structure is negative, or the number of missed event records in the
.I pmEventArray
array is negative.
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_TOOBIG
Either
.B vsp
indicates more than one value is present (all the event records
are expected to be packed in a single metric value), or
when unpacking the event records, the processing continues past the end of
the enclosing value.  Indicates corruption of the packed event record.
.TP 10n
PM_ERR_TYPE
Event parameters must have one of the arithmetic types, else
.BR PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE ,
.B PM_TYPE_STRING
or
.BR PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE_STATIC .
.TP 10n
other values < 0
refer to
.BR pmErrStr (3).

.BR PMAPI (3)
and
.BR pmFreeEventResult (3).
