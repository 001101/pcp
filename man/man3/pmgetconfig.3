.SH NAME
\f3pmGetConfig\f1 \- return Performance Co-Pilot configuration variable
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
char *pmGetConfig(const char *variable)
.sp
cc ... \-lpcp
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pmGetConfig
function searches for
.I variable
first in the environment and then, if not found, in
the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) configuration file
and returns the string result.
If
.I variable
is not already in the environment,
it is added with a call to
.BR putenv (3)
before returning.
.PP
The default location of the PCP configuration file is
.B /etc/pcp.conf
but this may be changed by setting
.B PCP_CONF
in the environment to a new location,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (4).
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If
.I variable
is not found in either the environment nor the PCP configuration file (or the
PCP configuration file is not found and
.B PCP_CONF
is not set in the environment),
then a fatal error message is printed and the process will
.BR exit (2).
Although this sounds drastic, it is the only course of action available
because the PCP configuration/installation is fatally flawed.
.PP
If this function returns,
the returned value points to a string in the environment and so changing
it is a bad idea.
This function returns the same type as the 
.BR getenv (3)
function (which should probably be a
.IR "const char *" ).
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (4).
Values for these variables may be obtained programatically
using the
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
function.

.SH DOCUMENTATION CAVEAT
This manual page originated from an earlier release of PCP for
.BR IRIX .
Although some porting effort has been made, there may be some remaining
inconsistencies with PCP for 
.B Linux
(and for other operating systems).
When this documentation is updated, this caveat will be removed.
