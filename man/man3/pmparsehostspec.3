.TH PMPARSEHOSTSPEC 3 "Aconex" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3__pmParseHostSpec\f1,
\f3__pmFreeHostSpec\f1 \- uniform host specification parser
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int __pmParseHostSpec(const char *string, pmHostSpec **rsltp, int *count, char **errmsg)
.sp
void __pmFreeHostSpec(pmHostSpec *rslt, int count)
.sp

.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B __pmParseHostSpec
accepts a
.B string
specifying the location of a PCP performance metric collector daemon.
.B
The syntax allows the initial
.BR pmcd (1)
hostname to be optionally followed by a list of port numbers,
which will be tried in order when connecting to
.B pmcd
on that host.
The portlist is separated from the hostname using a colon, and
each port in the list is comma-separated.
.PP
In addition, one or more optional
.BR pmproxy (1)
hosts can be specified (currently, only one proxy host is supported
by the PCP protocols).
These are separated from each other and from the
.B pmcd
component using the @ character.
These may also be followed by an optional port list, using the
same comma-separated syntax as before.
.PP
.B __pmParseHostSpec
takes a null-terminated host specification
.B string
and returns an array of 
.B pmHostSpec
structures, where the array has
.B count
entries.
.PP
These
.B pmHostSpec
structures that are returned via
.B rsltp
represent each individual host in the specification
.B string
and has the following
declaration:
.PP
.nf
.ft CW
    typedef struct {
        char    *name;       /* hostname (always valid) */
        int     *ports;      /* array of host port numbers */
        int     nports;      /* number of ports in host port array */
    } pmHostSpec;
.fi
.PP
.B __pmParseHostSpec
returns 0 if the given
.B string
was successfully parsed.  In this case all the storage allocated by
.B __pmParseHostSpec
can be released by calling
.B __pmFreeHostSpec
using the address returned from
.B __pmParseHostSpec
via
.BR rsltp .
.P
.B __pmParseHostSpec
returns
.B PM_ERR_GENERIC
and a dynamically allocated error message string in
.BR errmsg ,
if the given
.B string
does not parse, and the user-supplied
.B errmsg
pointer is non-null.
Be sure to
.BR free (3C)
the error message string in this situation.
.PP
In the case of an error,
.B rsltp
is undefined.
In the case of success,
.B errmsg
is undefined.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following are valid host specifications that specify connections to
.B pmcd
on host
.I app1.aconex.com
with/without a list of ports and with/without a
.B pmproxy
connection through a firewall.
