.SH NAME
\f3pmFetchArchive\f1 \- get performance metrics directly from an archive log
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int pmFetchArchive(pmResult **result)
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmFetchArchive
is a variant of 
.BR pmFetch (3)
that may only be used when the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context
is associated with an archive log.
.PP
The
.I result
is instantiated with all of the metrics (and instances)
from the next archive record,
consequently there is no notion of a list of desired metrics,
and the instance profile of the PMAPI context is ignored.
.PP
It is expected that 
.B pmFetchArchive
would be used to create utilities that scan archive logs,
while the more common access to the archives would be via the 
.BR pmFetch (3)
interface.
.PP
To skip records within the archive log, use
.BR pmSetMode (3)
to change the collection time within the current
PMAPI context, then call
.BR pmFetchArchive.
.PP
Note that the
.I result
returned by
.B pmFetchArchive
is dynamically allocated, and
must be released using
.BR pmFreeResult (3),
not
.BR free (3C).
See
.BR pmFetch (3)
and
.BR pmFreeResult (3)
for further details.
.PP
.B pmFetchArchive
returns zero on success.

and

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOTARCHIVE\f1
the current PMAPI context is not associated with an archive log
