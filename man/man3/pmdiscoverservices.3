.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CW

.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Given a PCP service name, as identified by
.IR service ,
and using the discovery mechanism(s) specified in
.IR discovery_domain ,
.B pmDiscoverServices
returns, via
.I urls ,
a list of urls representing the services discovered on the network.
.PP 
.IR service
specifies the PCP service to be discovered. Currently, only
.B PM_SERVER_SERVICE_SPEC
is supported, which searches for
.B PMCD
servers.
.PP 
.IR discovery_domain
specifies the discovery mechanism(s) to be used. Currently, only \fB"avahi"\fP
is supported. This searches for services which are broacasting using mDNS via
.B avahi-daemon.
.IR discovery_domain
may also be NULL, which means to use all available discovery mechanisims.
.PP 
Normally,
.B pmDiscoverServices
will return the number of services discovered, else a value
less than zero for an error.
The value zero indicates that no services were discovered.
.PP
The resulting list of pointers,
.IR urls ,
.B and
the values
(the urls) that the pointers reference will have been
allocated by
.B pmDiscoverServices
with a single call to
.BR malloc (3C),
and it is the
responsibility of the
.B pmDiscoverServices
caller to
.BR free (\c
.IR urls )
to release the space
when it is no longer required.
.PP
When an error occurs, or no services are discovered,
.I urls
is undefined (no space will have been
allocated, and so calling
.BR free (3C)
is a singularly bad idea).
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
Values for these variables may be obtained programmatically
using the
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
function.

.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmcd (1),
.BR pmfind (1),
.BR pmGetConfig (3),
.BR pcp.conf (5),
.BR pcp.env (5)
and
.BR avahi-daemon (8).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3EOPNOTSUPP\f1
The specified \fIdiscovery_domain\fP is not valid.
