.TH PMMGR 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmmgr\f1 \- pcp daemon manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmmgr\f1
[\f3\-v\f1]
[\f3\-c\f1 \f2config-directory\f1]
[\f3\-p\f1 \f2polling-interval\f1]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmmgr
manages a collection of PCP daemons for a set of discovered local and
remote hosts running the Performance Metrics Collection Daemon (PMCD),
according to zero or more configuration directories.  It keeps a
matching set of 
.IR pmlogger " and/or " pmie
daemons running, and their archives/logs merged/rotated.  It supplants
the older
.IR pmlogger_* " and " pmie_*
check/daily management shell scripts.
.P
pmmgr is largely self-configuring and perseveres despite most run-time
errors.  pmmgr runs in the foreground until interrupted.  When signaled,
it will stop its running daemons before exiting.
.P
A description of the command line options specific to
.B pmmgr
follows:
.TP 5
.B \-c
.I directory
adds a given configuration directory to pmmgr.  pmmgr can supervise
multiple different configurations at the same time.  Errors in the
configuration may be noted to standard error, but pmmgr will fill in
missing information with built-in defaults.  The default directory is
.I $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmmgr
.TP
.B \-p
.I polling-interval
sets the host-discovery polling interval to the given number of seconds.
The default is 60.
.TP
.B \-v
adds more verbose tracing to standard error.

.SH CONFIGURATION
A
.B pmmgr
configuration identifies which hosts should be monitored, which
daemons should be maintained for them, and what options those daemons
should be run with.  pmmgr uses a small number of files in a
configuration directory, instead of lines in a text file.  The
individual files carry zero or more lines of 100% pure configuration
text, and no comments.  (If desired, a configuration may be commented
upon with any other file, such as a free-form README.)

.SS TARGET SELECTION

This set of configuration files identifies where pmmgr should search
for pmcd instances, how to uniquely identify them, and where state
such as log files should be kept for each.  Ideally, a persistent &
unique host-id string is computed for each potential target pmcd from
specified metric values.  This host-id is also used as a subdirectory
name for locating daemon data.

.TP
hostid\-metrics
This file contains one or more lines of metric specifications in the format
accepted by 
.IR pmParseMetricSpec .
Metrics without instance specifiers mean all instances of that metric.
These are used to generate the 
.IR unique
host-id string for each pmcd server that pmmgr discovers.  Upon discovery,
all the metrics/instances named are queried, string values fetched, and
normalized/concatenated into a single hyphenated printable string.
The default is the single metric
.BR pmcd.hostname ,
which is sufficient if all the hosts discovered have unique hostname(2).  If
they don't, you should add other pcp metric specifications to set them apart
at your site.  The more you add, the longer the host-id string, but the more
likely that accidental duplication is prevented.  

However, it may be desirable for a host-id to also be
.IR persistent ,
so that if the target host goes offline and later returns, the new
host-id matches the previous one, because then old and new histories can be joined.
This argues against using metrics whose values vary from boot to boot.

Some candidate metrics to consider:
.IR network.interface.hw_addr ", " network.interface.inet_addr["eth0"] ", "
.IR network.interface.ipv6_addr ", " kernel.uname.nodename
.\" some others would be nice to have:
.\" CPU serial numbers
.\" VM uuid
.\" DMI serial numbers

.TP
log\-directory
This file contains the full path of a directory beneath which the per-host-id 
subdirectories are to be created by pmmgr.  This full path should not contain
shell metacharacter or spaces.  The default is 
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmmgr/ .

.TP
target\-host
This file contains one or more lines containing pmcd host specifications, as
described on the
.IR PCPintro (1)
man page.  Each poll interval, pmmgr will attempt to make a brief 
.IR pmNewContext
connection to the host to check liveness.  It is not a problem if more than
one specification for the same host is listed, because the host-id processing
eliminates duplicates, and chooses an arbitrary specification among them. 
The default is to target pmcd at
.BR local: .

.TP
target\-discovery
This file contains one or more lines containing specifications for the
.IR pmDiscoverServices
PMAPI call, each of which may map onto a fluctuating set of local or remote
pmcd servers.  Each poll interval, pmmgr will attempt to rerun discovery with
all of the given specifications.  Again it is not a problem if more than one
specification matches the same actual pmcd.  The default value is to do
.BR "no discovery" .

.SS PMLOGGER CONFIGURATION

This group of configuration options controls a 
.IR pmlogger
daemon for each host.  This may include generating its configuration,
and managing its archives.

.TP
pmlogger
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a 
.IR pmlogger
daemon for each
targeted host.  This file contains one line of additional space-separated options
for the pmie daemon.  (pmmgr already adds \-h, \-f, \-r, \-l, and perhaps \-c.)  The
default is to maintain
.BR "no pmlogger"
(and no other configuration in this section is processed).

.TP
pmlogconf
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will run 
.IR pmlogconf
to generate a configuration
file for each target pmcd.  The file contains one line of space-separated additional 
options for the pmlogconf program.  pmlogconf's generated output file will be stored under
the log\-directory/hostid subdirectory.  (pmmgr already adds \-c, \-r, and \-h.)  The
default is 
.BR "no pmlogconf" ,
so instead, the pmlogger file above should probably contain a \-c option, to
specify a fixed pmlogger configuration.

.TP
pmlogmerge
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will run 
.IR pmlogextract
to periodically merge together all preexisting log archives for each target pmcd
into one.  (When pmlogger is started, it always creates a new archive, so in the
steady state, there will be one merged archive from history, and one current archive
being written-to by pmlogger.)  The file contains an interval specification as per the
.IR PCPintro
man page, representing the period at which pmlogger should be temporarily stopped,
and archives merged.  The default is 
.BR 24hours .

.TP
pmlogmerge\-retain
If this file exists, pmmgr will set the relative starting time for retaining old
archived data.  It will be passed to pmlogextract as a negative parameter to \-S.
It is interpreted as a request that data older than the given interval should
be thrown away.  The default is
.BR 14days .

.SS PMIE CONFIGURATION

This group of configuration options controls a 
.IR pmie
daemon for each host.  This may include generating a custom
configuration.

.TP
pmie
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a 
.IR pmie
daemon for each
targeted pmcd.  This file contains one line of additional space-separated options
for the pmie daemon.  (pmmgr already adds \-h, \-f, \-l, and perhaps \-c.)  The
default is to maintain
.BR "no pmie"
(and no other configuration in this section is processed).

.TP
pmieconf
If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will run
.IR pmieconf
to generate a configuration
file for each target pmcd.  The file  contains one line of space-separated additional 
options for the pmieconf program.  pmieconf's generated output file will be stored under
the log\-directory/hostid subdirectory.  (pmmgr already adds \-F, \-c, and \-f.)  The
default is 
.BR "no pmieconf" ,
so instead, the pmie file above should probably contain a \-c option, to
specify a fixed pmie configuration.

.SH BUGS


.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parametrize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
