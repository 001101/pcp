<P>These notes present a glossary of terms and acronyms used within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), product marketing code SC4-PCP, and associated products. </P>
<HR>
<P><B>archive folio</B> - a collection of PCP <A HREF="#archive">archive logs</A> that can be processed as a group using <I>pmafm</I>. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="archive">archive log</B></A> - a set of physical files containing a collection of <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A> from a single <A HREF="#collector">collector system</A>. Archive logs are created by the program <I>pmlogger</I> and may be used with any PCP tools to provide retrospective performance
analysis. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="domain">domain</A> number</B> - each <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDA</A> is assigned a unique identifier (or domain number) that differentiates
PMDAs on a collector system. For global consistency, a particular PMDA will
be assigned the same domain number for <B>all</B> <A HREF="#collector">collector systems</A> on which it is installed. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="collector">collector system</B></A> - a host upon which a <A HREF="#PMCD">PMCD</A> is running to collect and export <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A> using the locally configured <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDAs</A>. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="instance identifiers">instance</B></A> <B>identifiers</B>- some <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A> have an associated <B>set</B> of values, e.g. the number of I/O disk operations is a metric, that has
a set of values, one per disk spindle on any particular system. Each value
is associated with an instance identifier that may be used to differentiate
between the values that particular performance metric. Instance identifiers
have both an internal (integer) encoding and an external (textual) name. </P>
<P><B>instance domain </B>- the set of <A HREF="#instance">instance identifiers</A> for a single <A HREF="#metric">performance metric</A>. Note that many metrics may share the same instance domain, e.g. per CPU,
or per network interface, or per Web server, and the members of an instance
domain are likely to be different on different hosts. </P>
<P><B>license</B> - PCP uses &quot;nodelocked&quot; licenses to control deployment of the software
components. There are two types of licenses, one for a <A HREF="#collector">collector system</A> and one for a <A HREF="#monitor">monitor system</A>. Where a host is configured as both a collector and a monitor system, both
licenses are required. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="monitor">monitor system</B></A> - a host upon which the PCP monitor tools are installed to support the display,
plotting, visualization and automated reasoning, using <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A> fetched from a <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDA</A>, or from a PCP archive log. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="PCP">PCP</B></A> - the Performance Co-Pilot. Also used to refer to the PCP product, marketing
code SC4-PCP. </P>
<P><B>PCPARRAY</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPARRAY) for performance management on SGI POWER
CHALLENGEArray platforms. </P>
<P><B>PCPFSAFE</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPFSAFE) for performance management on SGI FailSafe 2.x clusters. </P>
<P><B>PCPHPC</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPHPC) for performance management on HPC hosts
running DMF, HIPPI or MPI. </P>
<!--
<!-- <P><B>PCPINFMX7</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPINFMX7) for performance management on hosts
<!-- running the Informix RDBMS. </P>
  -->
<P><B>PCPORA</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPORA7) for performance management on hosts
running the ORACLE RDBMS. </P>
<!--
<!-- <P><B>PCPSYB10</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPSYB10) for performance management on hosts
<!-- running the Sybase RDBMS. </P>
  -->
<P><B>PCPWEB</B> - the add-on product (SC4-PCPWEB) for performance management on hosts running
World Wide Web servers. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="metric">performance metric</B></A> - any performance-related measurement of activity or resource utilization. </P>
<P><B>PDU</B> - Protocol Data Unit. In the PCP context this relates to the encoding of
PCP requests into messages for transmission via TCP/IP. PDUs are used to
implement all communication between the PCP monitor tools and a <A HREF="#PMCD">PMCD</A>, and between a PMCD and those <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDAs</A> that execute as separate processes. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="PMAPI">PMAPI</B></A> - Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface. The interface
by which an application developer gains access to PCP services that relate
to the fetching of <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A>. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="PMCD">PMCD</B></A> - Performance Metrics Collection Daemon. On each host configured as a PCP <A HREF="#collector">collector</A>, the PMCD services in-coming requests and controls the operation of the <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDAs</A>. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="PMDA">PMDA</B></A> - Performance Metrics Domain Agent. Each PMDA includes the methods necessary
to instantiate <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A> from a particular subsystem, e.g. IRIX or a RDBMS or an application, and
is launched by the <A HREF="#PMCD">PMCD</A>. It is expected that customized PMDAs will be developed for applications
with critical performance impacts. </P>
<P><B>PMCS</B> - Performance Metrics Collection System. The infrastructure used to collect,
export and transport <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A>, usually the combination of <A HREF="#PMCD">PMCD</A>, <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDAs</A> and <A HREF="#PMAPI">PMAPI</A> services. </P>
<P><B>PMNS</B> - Performance Metrics Name Space. A user-visible mapping between external
names and PMIDs for <A HREF="#metric">performance metrics</A>. A default PMNS is supplied, but individual users may customize their own
PMNS. </P>
<P><B>PMID</B> - Performance Metrics Identifier. Every <A HREF="#metric">performance metric</A> has an associated unique identifier. The high-order bits of the PMID encode
the corresponding <A HREF="#PMDA">PMDA</A>'s <A HREF="#domain">domain</A> number. </P>
