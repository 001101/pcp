# PCP QA Test No. 390
# Test out the proc agents handling of 
# mapping external instance names to internal instance names (pids).
# It was truncating the first number.
# i.e. if one does a "pmval -i "12345678" proc.psinfo.pid
#      it might return a value of "12345" on a 6.2 system
#
# This was written when qa/044 failed because it looked
# for what it thought was an impossible instance id but
# it wasn't because it was truncated.
