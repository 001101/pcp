@ dmthin.pool.metadata_used Number of metadata blocks used
The number of metadata blocks which are currently in use.

@ dmthin.pool.metadata_total Total number of metadata blocks
The total number of metadata blocks for the given thin storage pool.

@ dmthin.pool.data_used Number of data blocks used

@ dmthin.pool.held_root Location of metadata root

userspace read access. "-" indicates that there is no held root.

@ dmthin.pool.discard_passdown Discards passed or not
Whether or not discards are being passed down to the underlying device. 

@ dmthin.pool.read_mode Read mode of the thin pool
Indication of whether the pool is in read/write mode or read only mode.
In the event that the pool encounters certain types of device failures
it will drop into read-only metadata mode. 

@ dmthin.pool.no_space_mode Mode used when pool is out of space
If the pool runs out of data or metadata space, the pool will fallback
to either queuing or error any IO destined to the data device. The
default is to queue until more space is added to the pool.
