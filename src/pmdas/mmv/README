MMV (Memory Mapped Values) PMDA
===============================

General purpose PMDA to export values from appropriately formatted
files.

Metrics
=======

Since the entire name space for this PMDA in generated, there is no
help files - just use your judgement and name your metrics such that
one can understand what it supposed to mean from the names.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics

	$ pminfo mmv

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose
    another domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    provide the name of the directory with 'value' files, choose both
    the "collector" and "monitor" installation configuration options.
    Everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mmv.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
