memcached PMDA
==============

This PMDA extracts performance data from memcached, a distributed memory
caching daemon commonly used to improve web serving performance.  A farm
of memcached processes over multiple servers can be utilised by a single
web application, increasing the total available object cache size, and
decreasing the database load associated with smaller cache sizes.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT memcache

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit pmdamemcache.pl to use
    a different domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/memcache.log) should be checked for any
    warnings or errors.
