Database Ping PMDA
==================

Simple database response time measurement PMDA.  The dbprobe.pl
script should be configured to use the type of DBI appropriate
for your database, which includes: RDBMS flavour, user/password,
delay between "ping" requests, and the SQL statement to use.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT dbping

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit pmdadbping.pl to use
    a different domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dbping.log) should be checked for any
    warnings or errors.
