@apache.total_accesses Number of accesses since Apache started
Number of accesses (requests) Apache handled since start of the server.

@apache.total_kbytes KBytes transferred since Apache started
Number of kilobytes Apache transferred since start of the server.

@apache.uptime Seconds since Apache started
Number of seconds elapsed since the server was started.

@apache.requests_per_sec Requests per second
Average requests-per-second rate. Apache computes this as
total_accesses/uptime, so you'd better use delta of total_accesses to get
current rate.

@apache.bytes_per_sec Bytes per second
Average bytes-per-second rate. Apache computes this as total_kbytes/uptime,
so you'd better use delta of total_kbytes to get current rate.

@apache.bytes_per_requests Bytes per request
Average number of bytes per request. Apache computes this as
total_kbytes/total_accesses.

@apache.busy_servers Number of working processes
Number of Apache processes which are now working - reading requests,
receiving data, etc.  Together with idle_servers this number gives the
total number of running Apache processes.

@apache.idle_servers Number of idle processes
Number of Apache processes which are now idle - waiting for connection.
Together with busy_servers this number gives the total number of running
Apache processes.

@apache.sb_waiting Number of waiting processes
Number of Apache processes waiting for connection.

@apache.sb_starting Number of starting processes
Number of Apache processes just starting.

@apache.sb_reading Number of processes reading
Number of Apache processes reading a request.

@apache.sb_writing_reply Number of processes writing
Number of Apache processes writing a reply.

@apache.sb_keepalive Number of processes keeping-alive connection
Number of Apache processes waiting for next request on a keep-alive
connection.

@apache.sb_dns_lookup Number of processes doing DNS lookup
Number of Apache processes currently doing DNS lookup.

@apache.sb_logging Number of processes writing to log
Number of Apache processes writing to a log.

@apache.sb_finishing Number of proceses finishing
Number of Apache processes gracefuly finishing (becase the
RequestsPerChild limit was reached).

@apache.sb_open_slot Number of open slots
Number of open "slots" which could be occupied by a process. Together
with busy_servers and idle_servers, this gives the MaxClients value.
