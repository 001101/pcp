pmclient - a sample client using the PMAPI
==========================================

pmclient is a sample client that uses the Performance Metrics
Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to report some performance
data, collected from either a local host, a remote host, or a
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) performance metrics archive log.

The binary is shipped as part of pcp.sw.monitor and should be
installed in /usr/sbin/pmclient.  A "man" page is shipped in
pcp.man.pages.

The source is shipped as part of pcp.sw.demo and is installed in
/var/pcp/demos/pmclient.  If you have the C compiler installed, the
source and Makefile in this directory may be used to create a
functionally equivalent binary, simply by entering the command

	% make

The source in pmclient.c demonstrates most of the PMAPI services, and
may be used as a template and style guide when creating your own PMAPI
clients.  Note in particular, the use of ./pmnsmap.spec and the shipped
tool pmgenmap to assist in the creation of arguments to the PMAPI
routines, and the manipulation of PMAPI data structures.

To experiment with the archives,

	% rm -f mylog.*
	% /usr/pcp/bin/pmlogger -c config.pmclient -s 6 mylog

this will collect 30 seconds of performance data into the archive
stored as the files mylog.*.  To play this back,

	% pmclient -a mylog
