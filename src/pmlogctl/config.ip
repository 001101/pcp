#
# pmlogger configuration file for collecting ip-equivalent metrics
#
#
# metrics annotated "+" are not available from sar, but are available
# from PCP and are strongly related and useful
#
# metrics annotated "-" are not available from PCP because the sar
# metric is not a simple time average or rate converted value
#
# metrics annotated "X" are available in both, but the units may be
# different or some simple arithmetic (eg using pmie) may be required
# to produce the same values
#
# metrics annotated "?" are ones where the information is available,
# but relationship between the sar and the PCP metrics is not 1:1

log mandatory on default {
