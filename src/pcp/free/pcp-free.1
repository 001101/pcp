.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-free
gives a summary display of the total amount of free and used
physical memory and swap in the system, as well as the caches
used by the kernel.
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
.B pcp-free
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(PMCD) on the local host by default.
.PP
The
.B \-a
option causes
.B pcp-free
to use the specified archive rather than connecting to a PMCD.
When fetching from an archive, only
those instances present in the first archive record for a metric will
be displayed; see also the
.B \-O
option.
.PP
The
.B \-L
option causes
.B pcp-free
to use a local context to collect metrics from the kernel PMDA on the
local host without PMCD.
.PP
The
.BR \-a ,
.B \-h
and
.B \-L
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
When used in with an archive source of metrics the
.I time
argument to the
.B \-O
option defines a time origin at which the metrics should be
fetched from the archive.
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of this option, and the syntax for the
.I time
argument.
.PP
When the ``ctime'' format is used for the
.I time
argument to the
.B \-O
option, the timezone becomes an issue.
The default is to use the
local timezone on the
system where
.B pcp-free
is run.
.PP
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (5).
The
.B \-z
option changes the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
either the
.B \-a
or
.B \-h
option.
.SS Output Options
The \fB-b\fP switch displays the amount of memory in bytes; the
\fB-k\fP switch (set by default) displays it in kilobytes; the \fB-m\fP
switch displays it in megabytes.
.PP
The \fB-t\fP switch displays a line containing the totals.
.PP
The \fB-o\fP switch disables the display of a "buffer adjusted" line.
If the \fB-o\fP option is not specified, \fBfree\fP subtracts buffer memory
from the used memory and adds it to the free memory reported.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP switch activates continuous polling \fIdelay\fP seconds apart.
You may specify any floating point number for \fIdelay\fP, or indeed any valid
.BR pmParseInterval (3)
specification, which includes microsecond resolution delay times.
.PP
The current version of
.B pcp-free
can be queried using the
.B \-V
option.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-free
is inspired by the
.BR free (1)
command and aims to be output compatible with it.
.PP
The shared memory column should be ignored; it is obsolete.
