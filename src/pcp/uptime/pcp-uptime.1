.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp-uptime\f1
[\f3\-LVz\f1]
[\f3\-a\f1 \f2archive\f1]

[\f3\-Z\f1 \f2timezone\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-uptime
gives a one line display of the following information.
The current time,
how long the system has been running,
how many users are currently logged on,
and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
.B pcp-uptime
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(PMCD) on the local host by default.
.PP
The
.B \-a
option causes
.B pcp-uptime
to use the specified archive rather than connecting to a PMCD.
When fetching from an archive, only
those instances present in the first archive record for a metric will
be displayed; see also the
.B \-O
option.
.PP
The
.B \-L
option causes
.B pcp-uptime
to use a local context to collect metrics from the kernel PMDA on the
local host without PMCD.
.PP
The
.BR \-a ,
.B \-h
and
.B \-L
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
When used in with an archive source of metrics the
.I time
argument to the
.B \-O
option defines a time origin at which the metrics should be
fetched from the archive.
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of this option, and the syntax for the
.I time
argument.
.PP
When the ``ctime'' format is used for the
.I time
argument to the
.B \-O
option, the timezone becomes an issue.
The default is to use the
local timezone on the
system where
.B pcp-uptime
is run.
.PP
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (5).
The
.B \-z
option changes the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
either the
.B \-a
or
.B \-h
option.
.PP
The current version of
.B pcp-uptime
can be queried using the
.B \-V
option.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-uptime
is inspired by the
.BR uptime (1)
command and aims to be output compatible with it.
