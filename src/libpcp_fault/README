libpcp_fault is a version of libpcp that has fault injection capabilities
added.

This library is NOT intended to be packaged or shipped,
rather it is intended for use with the companion PCP QA suite
(git://oss.sgi.com/pcp/pcpqa)

Normal builds do not descend into this directory.

To build and use the library, cd into here, then

    $ cd src
    $ make qa_default
    $ sudo make qa_install
    $ make clean

To use the library in a test application, 

    #include <pcp/fault.h>

    ...

Then compile the code with -DPM_FAULT_INJECTION=1 and link
with -lpcp_fault -lpcp_pmda instead of -lpcp
