libpcp_fault is a version of libpcp that has fault injection capabilities
added.

This library is NOT intended to be packaged or shipped,
rather it is intended for use with the companion PCP QA suite
(git://oss.sgi.com/pcp/pcpqa)

Normal builds do not descend into this directory.

To build and use the library, cd into here, then

    $ cd src
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ make clean

To use the library in a test application, 

    #include <pcp/fault.h>

    ...

Then compile the code with -DPM_FAULT_INJECTION=1 and link with
-lpcp_fault instead of -lpcp

To use with an executable that is already linked, set $LD_PRELOAD in
the environment to the full pathname to the installed libpcp_fault, e.g.

    $ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpcp.so pminfo ...

The mechanisms for defining fault injection points and controlling the
triggering of fault injection is described in the brief "man" page
found in the this directory.  Review with

    $ man ./pmfault.3
