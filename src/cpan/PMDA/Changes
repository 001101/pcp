Revision history for Perl extension PCP::PMDA.

1.09  Sun Aug  1 09:04:38 EST 2010
	- Fix memory leak in fetch routine string handling.

1.08  Thu Nov 19 10:37:26 EST 2009
	- Fix typo on name export for pmda_inst_name.
	- Add a fast path lookup in pmda_inst_name for direct
	  instance identifier to offset case (common).
	- When tailing logfiles, seek to end initially so we
	  don't spend potentially copious amounts of time on
	  scanning the entire log file - we only want events
	  that happen after PMDA startup to be counted too.

1.07  Fri Aug 21 09:27:51 EST 2009
	- Add helper routines to determine native long sizes.

1.06  Wed Jul 22 12:49:43 EST 2009
	- Ensure the process runs in its own process group,
	  and block SIGTERM in atexit handler.  This resolves
	  a regression in the 1.05 fix for reaping children.

1.05  Tue Jul  8 16:19:49 EST 2009
	- Explicitly free all local temporaries immediately
	  for routines that call Perl from C (fixes memleak).
	- Fix an off-by-one when handling long input lines.
	- Terminate any children started by the PMDA at exit.

1.04  Mon Jul  6 11:08:20 EST 2009
	- Rewrote PMNS file generation to use libpcp routines.

1.03  Wed Jun 10 14:53:05 EST 2009
	- Incorporated Win32 build changes (paths, etc).
	- Remove (unneeded) use of hsearch and <search.h>.

1.02  Tue Jun  2 17:16:25 EST 2009
	- Implemented log file rotation and host reconnect handling.
	- Generally improved the file "tail" mode of operation.

1.01  Fri Feb 13 17:33:31 EST 2009
	- Added simple instance name lookup routine.

1.00  Thu Aug 20 08:48:14 EST 2008
	- Added several API components, 1st stable version.

0.04  Mon Feb 25 15:01:33 EST 2008
	- Smaller, but still incompatible, API refinements.

0.03  Sun Feb 24 09:06:39 EST 2008
	- API changes, moved existing Perl PMDAs out into PCP.

0.02  Wed Feb 20 16:38:38 EST 2008
	- port forward to Perl API changes (circa Perl 5.6).

0.01  Mon Sep 20 09:01:16 EST 1999
