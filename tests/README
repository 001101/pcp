Pre-Requisites
In order to perform the tests we'll make some assumptions

- python-rtslib is installed
- targetcli is installed
- the lio pmda has been installed successfully (either with selinux disabled
  or with a local policy active)

What the Test is
The test will create an ISCSI gateway as follows;
 - a single gateway and tpg (target portal group)
 - a 1GB LUN using a ramdisk
 - a client based on the local machines characteristics
 - a mapping of the LUN to the client

Once the LIO config is complete, the pmda is used to check the following
metrics
lio.summary.total_luns = 1
lio.summary.tpgs = 1
lio.summary.clients = 1
lio.lun.iops = 0
lio.lun.size = 1

If any of the above checks fail an exception will be raised

Once the test is complete, the LIO environment will be dropped automatically



How to Test
1. Make sure the pre-requisites are in place
2. Run the lio_test.py script
