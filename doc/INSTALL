Rebuilding kmchart

1. get the open source version of pcp 2.5.0 from oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp

2. apply patch.libpcp_pmc from the kmchart tarball
	- exports libpcp_pmc and the associated headers as a real library

3. go to the top of the patched pcp source
	$ make
	$ cd src/libpcp_pmc
	$ su
	# make install

   this will install libpcp_pmc and the associated headers

4. install the open source Qt run-time and developer pieces ... I'm using
	- qt-3.3.4
	- qt-devel-3.3.4
	- qt-designer-3.3.4

5. install the Qwt run-time and developer pieces ... I started with
	- qwt-4.2.0
	- qwt-devel-4.2.0
   but have since moved to the early access version of Qwt5.0
	- qwt-devel-20060125
	- qwt-20060125
   (for my build environment, Fedora Core 4, there were no RPMS I could
   find, so I rebuild them from source without drama after editing the
   qwt.spec file to _not_ make the designer plugin, remaking the tar ball
   and running rpmbuild ... source is available from the qwt project on
   sourceforge.net, http://qwt.sourceforge.net/snapshot/

6. go to the top of the kmchart source
	$ make

7. if you want/need to change UI components using Qt Designer, you may
   have to make some of Makefile, kmchart.pro, *.ui, *.ui.h and/or *.cpp
   writeable before changes from Designer can be saved and the
   application rebuilt.

8. play
	$ kmchart -c views/CPU
	$ kmchart -c views/Loadavg
