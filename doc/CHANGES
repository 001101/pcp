kmchart 1.0.0Beta3 (31 October 2007)
    - Next beta images - fixed export-to-image-file code, and a bunch
      of fixes in the switch-chart-type area.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta2 (29 October 2007)
    - Next beta images, improved time axis scaling and vertical chart
      alignment are the biggest source changes.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta1 (22 October 2007)
    - First beta images, as we lead up to the initial kmchart release.
    - Too many changes from 0.7 to outline, all across the board.

kmchart 0.7 (11 July 2007)
    - first git-based release of kmchart
    - numerous kmchart fixes and features
    - added kmquery, a Qt-based xconfirm and xmessage replacement that
      provides a consistent look to kmchart (needed particularly for a
      planned revamp to Record mode).

kmchart 0.6
    - kmtime support added
    - unified time axis introduced
    - support for tabs added to kmchart
    - support for simultaneous live and archive mode tabs
    - reworked metric selection dialog _completely_
    - shiny new icons added all over the shop
    - merged Load System View and Load User View dialogs

kmchart 0.5
[released ??? 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - fixed segv from "legend off" in view config
    - new tool - pm2km to convert pmchart views into kmchart views
    - added view configs for: Apache, CPU, Loadavg, NFS2, NFS3, Disk,
      Filesys, PMCD, Syscalls, Paging, Overview, Sockets, Cisco,
      ShpingCPU, ShpingElapsed
    - new GNUmakefile wrappers to work around Makefile being rebuilt
      by Qt Designer
    - File->Open System View now looks for system views in
      $(PCP_VAR_LIB)/config/kmchart
    - added support for plotting all instances of metrics with
      instance domains (see the Filesys view)
    - %i expands to instance name in plot legend
    - time counters are rate converted and scaled, so plotted in the range
      0.0 to 1.0
    - saving of configuration through File->Save User View now works

kmchart 0.4.1
[released 28 Feb 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - fix small botch in 0.4 release

kmchart 0.4
[released 28 Feb 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - view (config) parser added, so can now load user and systems views,
      supporting both the old pmchart syntax and some kmchart improvements
    - QA suite created (more pcpqa for the fans)
    - small PCP 2.5.0 patch with just the required libpmc changes
    - better handling of minimum size and resizing
    - for New->Plot, default style is always Line (inheriting the
      default from the previous chart was just plain wrong)
    - handle pmchart syntax for instance or pattern in view config
      file (no quotes, use text to end of line), as well as kmchart syntax
      (instance identifiers enclosed in quotes)
    - %h expands to hostname in chart title
    - one timer for all charts (as opposed to one time for each chart), so
      all time axes are temporally correlated (reduced memory footprint as
      a side effect)
    - plot color shown as a block in the legend for improved usability
    - Edit->Delete->chart implemented
    - current chart highlighted with color change for axes and titles
      (black->red)
    - improved top-level re-sizing logic
    - File->New Plot is now a modeless dialog, so plots appear in the main
      window as they are created
    - File->Print implemented, although it only prints the current chart
      at this stage
    - Help->About implemented
    - Edit->Colors implemented
    - Autoscaling logic fixed up so it actually works now
    - Loadavg and CPU as first views

kmchart 0.3
[released 17 Jan 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - move Qwt base from 4.2 to 5.0 beta (20050831 at this stage)
    - add to current and create new chart both functional in MetricSelection
      dialog
    - metrics really being fetched using libpcp_pmc methods ... real data
      values being used for plots
    - complete overhaul for the APIs to the Chart and Plot classes
    - fixed y-axis scaling dialog behaviour
    - Edit->Colors ... implemented
    - plot data arrays allocated dynamically (in preparation for *History
      changes on command line and via UI)
    - common x-axis time data across all charts and single timer thread
      so all charts updated at the same time
    - initial support for left-mouse selection of "current" chart in a
      multi-chart configuration ... and some visible feedback (title and
      y-axis label appear in red)
    - update interval specified via -t on command line
    - initial view loading support through -c config on command line (hack
      to load hard-coded CPU view, i.e. no view config file parser,
      at the moment to demonstrate completeness of API into the Chart
      and Plot classes
    - initial #-cycle support for default color rotation for plots within
      a chart
    - pale blue rather than grey for the plot canvas background
    - rudimentary chart resizing with outer window resizing
    - full support for Stack, Util, Area and Line plots, including changing
      style on the fly via the UI
    - add support for Legend labels as alternative to the default metric
      specification being used (enhancement over pmchart) 
    - make MetricSelection dialog modeless
    - added File->Print support
    - added Help->About support
    - graph Title and Legend manipulation in the UI works now
    - changing host/archive source in MetricSelection does not keep adding
      the same hosts/archives to the selection list ... and the PMNS
      transition now appears to be correct
    - instance domains for archive contexts are loaded using
      pmGetIndomArchive() rather than pmGetIndom() to remove any temporal
      dependency in the possible instances

kmchart 0.2 [mailed out 4 Jan 2006]
    - added plot legend handling (a la the Qwt bode example with some
      enhancements)
    - fix Edit->Chart Title and Legend so that it really controls the
      show/hide function of the plot Legend
    - rework Graph::addPlot() to get metric spec into the Graph class
    - remove the last vestiages of the global currentChart struct, moving
      the associated data into the Graph class
    - make changes in Edit->Y Axis Scaling stick after dialog done
    - ensure consistent handling of Chart Style changes
    - improve resizing of main window after a new Chart is added

kmchart 0.1 [mailed out 2 Jan 2006]
    -  initial version
