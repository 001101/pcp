kmchart 1.1.0 (23 April 2008)
    - Added kmsnap(1) for automating chart image generation.
    - Reworked the time axis layout management.
    - Fixed the Dock icons on Mac OS X.
    - Fixed the packaging on Mac OS X, so that the pre-built
      packages install on both 10.4 and 10.5, and such that
      kmchart is installed like other "real" Applications.
    - Fixed issues with generated images (fonts and layouts)
    - Fixed several issues surrounding legends, which we now draw
      without the surrounding frame by default - only when a plot
      is disabled is its legend drawn indented now, which gives a
      much cleaner default UI in the default case.
    - Default to png image format, if none other requested, as
      it is always supported in all Qt builds (unlike gif).

kmchart 1.0.0 (5 March 2008)
    - Fix the handling of missed updates in live mode - no longer
      clears the entire history every time that happens.
    - Fix up error handling in case of failed pmlogger processes.
    - Fix kmtime handling of the time bounds when additional logs
      are added on-the-fly.
    - Fix timezone setting problem.
    - Make background preference changes affect existing charts.
    - Enable local context mode (-L option).
    - Switch to "release" Qt make options instead of "debug".

kmchart 1.0.0rc7 (21 February 2008)
    - Debian packaging, hooray!
    - Update "tab" keyword to allow a default host for each tab

kmchart 1.0.0rc6 (13 February 2008)
    - Huge number of man page, online help text and web docs updated
      (body of all docs now complete, could use some review though).
    - Added "tab" keyword to the view file format.

kmchart 1.0.0rc5 (16 January 2008)
    - SRPM and source tarball build fix (missing targets).
    - man page updates.

kmchart 1.0.0rc4 (10 January 2008)
    - Desktop integration for GNOME and KDE.
    - Fixed some install problems when building from SRPM.
    - Try harder to install as root.root before falling back to using
      the build user.group combination.

kmchart 1.0.0rc3 (23 November 2007)
    - Fixed a nasty regression in the last VCR mode changes, and
      commented out an earlier fix too - that one will need some
      re-engineering as its too slow (see git log for details).
    - This versions useable however, so its the first real -rc.

kmchart 1.0.0rc2 (22 November 2007)
    - Two timezone related fixes.
    - Initial work on Gnome/KDE desktop integration.

kmchart 1.0.0rc1 (21 November 2007)
    - Stop/start VCR mode changes for live mode
    - Fix+re-enable the "side step" code, which detects kmtime steps
      that are more than a delta greater than expected, and fills in
      the intervening area with NaN values (i.e. a hole is plotted).
    - Documentation and small fixes are the only remaining issues.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta7 (15 November 2007)
    - Record mode work, automatic Tab creation for replay is now
      working well.
    - Resolve some time axis issues, although I think some remain.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta6 (8 November 2007)
    - Modification to the time interval in kmtime now does the right
      thing in kmchart.
    - Several difficult time control issues resolved - fast fwd and
      high speed play now work well.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta5 (7 November 2007)
    - Fix the issue where, when started in archive mode, a Live tab's
      time axis wasn't being updated at all.
    - Fix time axis in chart export/print mechanism.
    - Archive time axis looks sensible when started in live mode now.
    - Fix up default new tab label when switching live/archive.
    - Disable antialiasing for Loadavg view (all instantaneous metrics)

kmchart 1.0.0Beta4 (1 November 2007)
    - Allow installs on MacOSX 10.5 as well
    - Fix srpm build issues
    - Resolve kmtime layout issues on Mac/Fedora

kmchart 1.0.0Beta3 (31 October 2007)
    - Next beta images - fixed export-to-image-file code, and a bunch
      of fixes in the switch-chart-type area.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta2 (29 October 2007)
    - Next beta images, improved time axis scaling and vertical chart
      alignment are the biggest source changes.

kmchart 1.0.0Beta1 (22 October 2007)
    - First beta images, as we lead up to the initial kmchart release.
    - Too many changes from 0.7 to outline, all across the board.

kmchart 0.7 (11 July 2007)
    - first git-based release of kmchart
    - numerous kmchart fixes and features
    - added kmquery, a Qt-based xconfirm and xmessage replacement that
      provides a consistent look to kmchart (needed particularly for a
      planned revamp to Record mode).

kmchart 0.6
    - kmtime support added
    - unified time axis introduced
    - support for tabs added to kmchart
    - support for simultaneous live and archive mode tabs
    - reworked metric selection dialog _completely_
    - shiny new icons added all over the shop
    - merged Load System View and Load User View dialogs

kmchart 0.5
[released ??? 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - fixed segv from "legend off" in view config
    - new tool - pm2km to convert pmchart views into kmchart views
    - added view configs for: Apache, CPU, Loadavg, NFS2, NFS3, Disk,
      Filesys, PMCD, Syscalls, Paging, Overview, Sockets, Cisco,
      ShpingCPU, ShpingElapsed
    - new GNUmakefile wrappers to work around Makefile being rebuilt
      by Qt Designer
    - File->Open System View now looks for system views in
      $(PCP_VAR_LIB)/config/kmchart
    - added support for plotting all instances of metrics with
      instance domains (see the Filesys view)
    - %i expands to instance name in plot legend
    - time counters are rate converted and scaled, so plotted in the range
      0.0 to 1.0
    - saving of configuration through File->Save User View now works

kmchart 0.4.1
[released 28 Feb 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - fix small botch in 0.4 release

kmchart 0.4
[released 28 Feb 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - view (config) parser added, so can now load user and systems views,
      supporting both the old pmchart syntax and some kmchart improvements
    - QA suite created (more pcpqa for the fans)
    - small PCP 2.5.0 patch with just the required libpmc changes
    - better handling of minimum size and resizing
    - for New->Plot, default style is always Line (inheriting the
      default from the previous chart was just plain wrong)
    - handle pmchart syntax for instance or pattern in view config
      file (no quotes, use text to end of line), as well as kmchart syntax
      (instance identifiers enclosed in quotes)
    - %h expands to hostname in chart title
    - one timer for all charts (as opposed to one time for each chart), so
      all time axes are temporally correlated (reduced memory footprint as
      a side effect)
    - plot color shown as a block in the legend for improved usability
    - Edit->Delete->chart implemented
    - current chart highlighted with color change for axes and titles
      (black->red)
    - improved top-level re-sizing logic
    - File->New Plot is now a modeless dialog, so plots appear in the main
      window as they are created
    - File->Print implemented, although it only prints the current chart
      at this stage
    - Help->About implemented
    - Edit->Colors implemented
    - Autoscaling logic fixed up so it actually works now
    - Loadavg and CPU as first views

kmchart 0.3
[released 17 Jan 2006 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcpaddons]
    - move Qwt base from 4.2 to 5.0 beta (20050831 at this stage)
    - add to current and create new chart both functional in MetricSelection
      dialog
    - metrics really being fetched using libpcp_pmc methods ... real data
      values being used for plots
    - complete overhaul for the APIs to the Chart and Plot classes
    - fixed y-axis scaling dialog behaviour
    - Edit->Colors ... implemented
    - plot data arrays allocated dynamically (in preparation for *History
      changes on command line and via UI)
    - common x-axis time data across all charts and single timer thread
      so all charts updated at the same time
    - initial support for left-mouse selection of "current" chart in a
      multi-chart configuration ... and some visible feedback (title and
      y-axis label appear in red)
    - update interval specified via -t on command line
    - initial view loading support through -c config on command line (hack
      to load hard-coded CPU view, i.e. no view config file parser,
      at the moment to demonstrate completeness of API into the Chart
      and Plot classes
    - initial #-cycle support for default color rotation for plots within
      a chart
    - pale blue rather than grey for the plot canvas background
    - rudimentary chart resizing with outer window resizing
    - full support for Stack, Util, Area and Line plots, including changing
      style on the fly via the UI
    - add support for Legend labels as alternative to the default metric
      specification being used (enhancement over pmchart) 
    - make MetricSelection dialog modeless
    - added File->Print support
    - added Help->About support
    - graph Title and Legend manipulation in the UI works now
    - changing host/archive source in MetricSelection does not keep adding
      the same hosts/archives to the selection list ... and the PMNS
      transition now appears to be correct
    - instance domains for archive contexts are loaded using
      pmGetIndomArchive() rather than pmGetIndom() to remove any temporal
      dependency in the possible instances

kmchart 0.2 [mailed out 4 Jan 2006]
    - added plot legend handling (a la the Qwt bode example with some
      enhancements)
    - fix Edit->Chart Title and Legend so that it really controls the
      show/hide function of the plot Legend
    - rework Graph::addPlot() to get metric spec into the Graph class
    - remove the last vestiages of the global currentChart struct, moving
      the associated data into the Graph class
    - make changes in Edit->Y Axis Scaling stick after dialog done
    - ensure consistent handling of Chart Style changes
    - improve resizing of main window after a new Chart is added
